# corona-check-in-app

An android application for tracking infections in a university. This project was build
during the MC1 module in combination with WE1 in which we build the backend, which is running on 
a azure cloud instance. Because of this, you will have to wait before the first request will go
through, as the backend will have a cold start, which can take up to 4 minutes.
